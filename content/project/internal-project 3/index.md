summary: The Classical Newsboy Problem deals mainly with mean minimizing solution to obtain the optimal order quantity. In this paper we would resort to some Alternative Optimality Criteria to obtain the optimal order quantity, namely 'Minimization of Standard Deviation of the Cost Distribution', 'Minimization of Coefficient of Variation of the Cost Distribution', 'Minimization of Standard Deviation Penalized Mean of the Cost Distribution',
'Minimization of the Modal Cost' and 'Minimization of the probability of the Cost Distribution exceeding a given high value'. Considering two realistic situations, i.e., firstly when supply is same and secondly when supply varies with the order quantity, we discuss the above procedures briefly with derivations and numerical illustrations.

title: Newsvendor Problem : Alternative Optimality Criteria
---


We consider the Newsvendor model where a newspaper vendor starts with ‘q’ newspapers. Let the demand be random. As a result, he eventually incurs either shortage cost or excess cost corresponding to excess demand or lack of demand.
The classical solution involves the determination of the optimal order quantity by mean minimizing the total cost.

In this paper, some alternative methods of determining the optimal order quantity are considered, which are as follows:
1. If the standard deviation of the distribution of cost is large enough, then    mean minimization of the cost distribution may not give a satisfactory         result as the actual cost incurred in any particular case may be higher than    the expected cost.
   Under this circumstance, the optimal order quantity may be obtained by,
   a) `MINIMISING THE STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE COST DISTRIBUTION`.
   b) `MINIMISING THE COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION OF THE COST DISTRIBUTION`.
   
2. The optimal order quantity may also be obtained by minimizing the sum of       expectation and ‘k’ times the standard deviation of the cost deviation,        where k is a chosen constant, i.e. by `MINIMISING THE STANDARD DEVIATION        PENALISED MEAN OF THE COST DISTRIBUION`.
3. Ensuring that the maximum possible cost is minimized (similar in principal     to the Minimax criterion) the optimal orders may be obtained by `MINIMISING     THE MODAL COST`.
4. Another approach to find out the optimal order quantity is to safeguard        against the cost by `MINIMISING THE PROBABILITY OF THE COST DISTRIBUTION       EXCEEDING A GIVEN HIGH VALUE`.
