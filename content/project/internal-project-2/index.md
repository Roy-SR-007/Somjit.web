summary: Classical Newsboy Problem accepts the monotonicity of the job of newsboys but offers great profits. In this practical situation, newsboys has a certain amount of newspapers with them, the demand (X) of newspapers being random. In the following problem proposed considering two cases: supply of newspapers- when it is same and random with respect to order quantity, we derive the optimal order quantity using the cost function for different probability distributions which the demand follows, by mean minimizing technique and thus finding out total optimal cost.

title: Situations of Random Supply in the Classical Newsboy Problem
---

This paper was presented and published in the 107th Indian Science Congress (ISC) held at the University of Agricultural Sciences, GKVK Campus, Bangalore. The research was conducted as a group including myself and my classmates - Tishyo Chakraborty, Soham Biswas and Arpita Saha, under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Ayan Chandra (Associate Professor in Department of Statistics at St.Xavier's College, Kolkata).

In this paper we consider the Classical Newsboy (or Newsvendor) Problem. In this problem, a newsboy starts his day with a certain amount, say ‘q’, newspapers with him. The demand being random, at the end of the day he might face shortage or may be left with some excess newspapers in his hand. Accordingly, he has to incur shortage or excess cost. The demand being random, naturally, the cost incurred will also be a random variable. The problem is to determine the optimal order quantity (q) so that the expected total cost is minimized.

We have considered a more practical situation where whatever is ordered by the newspaper vendor, it is not same as what is received. In other words, Supply is not same as the order quantity. This problem often arises in production inventory situation. Here we have considered the situation where supply varies around the order quantity. Demand distribution of both finite range (viz., Beta with varying parameters, Rectangular Distribution with its parameters) and infinite range (viz., exponential) have been considered, while supply has been considered to vary uniformly around the order quantity. Some numerical examples have also been worked out and a comparison of optimal order quantity and the optimal cost between the classical situation and the situation of random supply has been conducted.
