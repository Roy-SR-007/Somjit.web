This is my Dissertation Paper in the third year of my undergraduate degree in Statistics. The research was completed and the paper was compiled under the supervisions of Prof. Pallabi Ghosh (Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at St.Xavier's College, Kolkata) and Dr. Prof. Durba Bhattacharya (HOD - Department of Statistics at St.Xavier's College, Kolkata), along with the guidance and the topic of research itself suggested by Dr. Prof. Ayan Chandra (Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics at St.Xavier's College, Kolkata).

Key features to look out for :: Expected Duration of Play, Homogeneous and In-homogeneous Linear Difference Equations, Stochastic Processes, Random Walks and corresponding absorbed states, Markov Chains, Transition Probabilities and Matrices, Monte Carlo Simulations to name a few.  

Beginning with the general introduction of the situations, a gambler can be in, the paper comprises of various applications of Gambler's Ruin Problem, along with the general introductions of the different problem setups. The solution to the problem has been provided using homogeneous linear difference equations. The paper includes one of the most frequently visited problems in the gambling world, viz. the 'Expected Duration of Play'. The approach to solve the expected duration of play has been a bit different in this paper, i.e., through relevant simulations along with a theoretical solution using non-homogeneous linear difference equations.

Primary concepts associated to the problem at hand, such as Stochastic Processes, Random Walks and Markov Chains has been illustrated both theoretically as well as through instances and simulations.

The usage of transition probabilities and transition probability matrices helped to add another dimension to the solution of the Gambler's Ruin Problem.

Categorical usage of Monte Carlo Simulations has been done to simulate different gambling games, along with the multi-dimensional gambler's ruin problem, i.e., the N-player ruin game.
