Somjit Roy is currently an undergrad in Statistics at St.Xavier's College (Autonomous), Kolkata. Having done his schooling from The Assembly of God Church School, with his majors in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Science, he was always inclined towards Maths and Computer Science, also developing a knack for Organic Chemistry. Being drawn towards Mathematics majorly, he is completing his undergraduate degree in Statistics, with main interests and focus in Theoretical and Applied Statistics (Design Of Experiments, Time Series Analysis and Statistical Quality Control), Applied Probability (Probability Theory, Stochastic Processes, Markov Chains, Random Walks and Martingales), Data Science and Machine Learning.   

As far as the Non-Statistics Background is concerned, he focuses on development of interactive web applications and found himself to invest a fair share of his time in developing R-Packages to enhance the applicability of the theories and concepts learned in his undergraduate days. Also he likes to spent a bit of his time on platforms like Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon Prime and Spotify.
